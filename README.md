# Helicopter Video Game
This was a capstone project for EE178 (Digital Design with FPGAs) at San Jose State University during the Fall 2015 semester.

The result was a playable and addictive helicopter game that uses a small processor (PicoBlaze) embedded in an FPGA design. The game was primarily written in Assembly Language with a Verilog backend for interfacing FPGA I/Oâ€™s and to output the game display.
