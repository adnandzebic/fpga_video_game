If this cell is a user instantiated LUT in the design, please remove connectivity to the pin or change the equation and/or INIT string of the LUT to prevent this issue. If the cell is inferred or IP created LUT, please regenerate the IP and/or resynthesize the design to attempt to correct the issue.

WARNING: [DRC 23-20] Rule violation (PDRC-153) Gated clock check - Net vga_example_inst/my_linedraw/next_state_reg[1]_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin vga_example_inst/my_linedraw/next_state_reg[1]_i_2/O, cell vga_example_inst/my_linedraw/next_state_reg[1]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
WARNING: [DRC 23-20] Rule violation (RTSTAT-10) No routable loads - 94 net(s) have no routable loads. The problem bus(es) and/or net(s) are kcpsm6_inst/spm_enable_lut/O5, kcpsm6_inst/read_strobe_lut/O5, kcpsm6_inst/address_loop[0].lsb_pc.pc_muxcy_n_0, kcpsm6_inst/address_loop[1].upper_pc.mid_pc.pc_muxcy_n_0, kcpsm6_inst/address_loop[2].upper_pc.mid_pc.pc_muxcy_n_0, kcpsm6_inst/address_loop[4].upper_pc.mid_pc.pc_muxcy_n_0, kcpsm6_inst/address_loop[5].upper_pc.mid_pc.pc_muxcy_n_0, kcpsm6_inst/address_loop[6].upper_pc.mid_pc.pc_muxcy_n_0, kcpsm6_inst/address_loop[8].upper_pc.mid_pc.pc_muxcy_n_0, kcpsm6_inst/address_loop[9].upper_pc.mid_pc.pc_muxcy_n_0, quad_seven_seg_inst/counter_reg[0]_i_1_n_1, quad_seven_seg_inst/counter_reg[0]_i_1_n_2, quad_seven_seg_inst/counter_reg[0]_i_1_n_3, quad_seven_seg_inst/counter_reg[4]_i_1_n_1, quad_seven_seg_inst/counter_reg[4]_i_1_n_2 (the first 15 of 91 listed).
