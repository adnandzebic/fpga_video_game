2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
PDCN-1569#1 Warning
LUT equation term check  
Used physical LUT pin 'A1' of cell kcpsm6_inst/middle_zero_lut/LUT5 (in kcpsm6_inst/middle_zero_lut macro) is not included in the LUT equation: 'O5=0'. If this cell is a user instantiated LUT in the design, please remove connectivity to the pin or change the equation and/or INIT string of the LUT to prevent this issue. If the cell is inferred or IP created LUT, please regenerate the IP and/or resynthesize the design to attempt to correct the issue.
Related violations: <none>

PDCN-1569#2 Warning
LUT equation term check  
Used physical LUT pin 'A2' of cell kcpsm6_inst/middle_zero_lut/LUT5 (in kcpsm6_inst/middle_zero_lut macro) is not included in the LUT equation: 'O5=0'. If this cell is a user instantiated LUT in the design, please remove connectivity to the pin or change the equation and/or INIT string of the LUT to prevent this issue. If the cell is inferred or IP created LUT, please regenerate the IP and/or resynthesize the design to attempt to correct the issue.
Related violations: <none>

PDCN-1569#3 Warning
LUT equation term check  
Used physical LUT pin 'A3' of cell kcpsm6_inst/middle_zero_lut/LUT5 (in kcpsm6_inst/middle_zero_lut macro) is not included in the LUT equation: 'O5=0'. If this cell is a user instantiated LUT in the design, please remove connectivity to the pin or change the equation and/or INIT string of the LUT to prevent this issue. If the cell is inferred or IP created LUT, please regenerate the IP and/or resynthesize the design to attempt to correct the issue.

PDCN-1569#4 Warning
LUT equation term check  
Used physical LUT pin 'A4' of cell kcpsm6_inst/middle_zero_lut/LUT5 (in kcpsm6_inst/middle_zero_lut macro) is not included in the LUT equation: 'O5=0'. If this cell is a user instantiated LUT in the design, please remove connectivity to the pin or change the equation and/or INIT string of the LUT to prevent this issue.

PDCN-1569#5 Warning

PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net vga_example_inst/my_linedraw/next_state_reg[1]_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin vga_example_inst/my_linedraw/next_state_reg[1]_i_2/O, cell vga_example_inst/my_linedraw/next_state_reg[1]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

RTSTAT-10#1 Warning
No routable loads  
94 net(s) have no routable loads. The problem bus(es) and/or net(s) are kcpsm6_inst/spm_enable_lut/O5, kcpsm6_inst/read_strobe_lut/O5, kcpsm6_inst/address_loop[0].lsb_pc.pc_muxcy_n_0, kcpsm6_inst/address_loop[1].upper_pc.mid_pc.pc_muxcy_n_0, kcpsm6_inst/address_loop[2].upper_pc.mid_pc.pc_muxcy_n_0, kcpsm6_inst/address_loop[4].upper_pc.mid_pc.pc_muxcy_n_0, kcpsm6_inst/address_loop[5].upper_pc.mid_pc.pc_muxcy_n_0, kcpsm6_inst/address_loop[6].upper_pc.mid_pc.pc_muxcy_n_0, kcpsm6_inst/address_loop[8].upper_pc.mid_pc.pc_muxcy_n_0, kcpsm6_inst/address_loop[9].upper_pc.mid_pc.pc_muxcy_n_0, quad_seven_seg_inst/counter_reg[0]_i_1_n_1, quad_seven_seg_inst/counter_reg[0]_i_1_n_2, quad_seven_seg_inst/counter_reg[0]_i_1_n_3, quad_seven_seg_inst/counter_reg[4]_i_1_n_1, quad_seven_seg_inst/counter_reg[4]_i_1_n_2 (the first 15 of 91 listed).
